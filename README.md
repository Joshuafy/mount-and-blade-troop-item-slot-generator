# mount-and-blade-troop-item-slot-generator
Tools to auto generate slot assignment code for Mount &amp; Blade: Warband 
items (by item type) and troops.  Input comes from text files in the same
directory named itemsource.txt and troopsource.txt containing the source 
code you want to generate the slot assignments for.  The current slot 
assignments were from my personal project, but the slot numbers can be 
edited for your own needs.  Run from command line.
