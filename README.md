# mount-and-blade-troop-item-slot-generator
Tools to auto generate slot assignment code for Mount &amp; Blade: Warband 
items (by item type) and troops.  Input comes from a text files named
itemsource.txt and troopsource.txt containing the source code you want
to generate the slot assignments for.  The current slot assignments
were from my personal project, but the slot numbers can be edited for
your own needs.
